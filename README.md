Part 1: Data Analysis and Insight

The "Birds of India" dataset is a collection of records detailing bird species observed across India. It includes 200 columns and 4 rows: the common name, scientific name, date of the last observation, and the total number of times each species has been recorded. This data likely originates from birdwatching logs or biodiversity platforms, serving purposes such as ecological research, conservation tracking, or hobbyist birdwatching. It provides a snapshot of avian diversity and observation trends, helping to understand species presence and monitoring frequency in the Indian subcontinent.
