# Project 1: Data Analysis and Insight
## Data Overview
The "Birds of India" dataset is a collection of records detailing bird species observed across India. It includes 203 rows and 4 columns: the common name, scientific name, date of the last observation, and the total number of times each species has been recorded. Out of these entries, 199 species have been identified by their common names, and an equal number by their scientific names, suggesting that each species is uniquely cataloged without overlap or duplication. The dataset spans bird observations collected over more than two years, with the earliest entry dated June 28, 2022, and the latest recorded on December 7, 2024. While most species have recorded dates, some entries show “No Observations”, indicating they weren’t sighted during this period. The most frequently seen was the Great Egret (Ardea alba), with 262,358 sightings. In contrast, the Black-faced Laughingthrush (Trochalopteron affine) had no recorded sightings, suggesting it was either rare or unobserved.

Figure 1: Observation Extremes of Selected Bird Species in India.

The chart shows six highest total observations for bird species in India.The Great Egret leads with over 260,000 sightings, followed by the Grey Heron and Black-crowned Night Heron with around 140,000 and 110,000 sightings respectively.The Gadwall, Little Egret, and Northern Shoveler have moderate counts between 70,000 and 90,000. This highlights the Great Egret as the most frequently observed species among all birdsin India.

Insight 2: Peak Observation Date

Figure 2: Peak Observation Date for Selected Bird Species in India

The graph shows the peak number of bird species observed by day. Many species such as Great Egret, Grey Heron, Northern Shoveler and Black-crowned Night Heron peaked as the most observed species on 7 December 2024, suggesting this may have been a large survey or time of intensive data entry.
