# Part 1: Data Analysis and Insight
## Data Overview
The "Birds of India" dataset is a collection of records detailing bird species observed across India. It includes 203 rows and 4 columns: the common name, scientific name, date of the last observation, and the total number of times each species has been recorded. This data likely originates from birdwatching logs or biodiversity platforms, serving purposes such as ecological research, conservation tracking, or hobbyist birdwatching. It provides a snapshot of avian diversity and observation trends, helping to understand species presence and monitoring frequency in the Indian subcontinent.
## Data Cleaning
Missing Value:
* There is no missing value in each columns.

Duplicate rows:
* There are 3 duplicate values found and removed.
## Descriptive Statistics
Insight 1:
Most bird species in the dataset have relatively low observation counts, with the average being around (6778,46). This suggests that while a few species are frequently observed, the majority are likely less common or harder to spot.

Insight 2:
The large difference between the minimum and maximum observations indicates a high level of variation in species visibility or reporting. Conservation efforts might focus on species with consistently low observation numbers to ensure they are not at risk.
